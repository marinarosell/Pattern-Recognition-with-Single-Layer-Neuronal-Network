# Pattern Recognition with Single Layer Neuronal Network

Development of an application, based on unconstrained optimization algorithms, that allow to recognize the numbers in a sequence of blurred digits. 

The procedure to achieve that goal was to formulate a Single Layer Neural Network that is trained to recognize the different numbers with First Derivative Optimization methods.
